Yesterday and today marked the first steps in my journey of creating a full scale, deployable web app with a team of three other Hack Reactor cohort mates. Jonathan C., Ovidiu Buta, and Eugene Hong I are designing and building a trivia based single player game using ReactJS, FastAPI, MongoDB and Redux, which will track user game stats, incorporate a simple social networking feature, and *as stretch goals* integrate game music + a modern GUI.

I'll be chronicling our progress here, as we weave together user authentication, gameplay, and myriad APIs. I know it won't be easy, but I'm excited to take the next step towards becoming a full stack web developer!

Today we finished our api endpoint markdown and began planning our project implementation. I set up API Endpoint, React/Redux frontend, and Documentation boards on Trello and led the standup/standown. In tandem with our design overview, we worked individually through the FastAPI tutorial videos to familiarize ourselves with the new framework.
I find FastAPI / PostgreSQL to be quite dense so far, and am looking forward to completing more tutorials and getting a few of our endpoints up and running by the end of the week. Excited to learn about authorization bearer tokens, and will try to get a basic version of the game working in React by next week.

We focused on getting the game and user databases up and running today using PostgreSQL and FastAPI. It was not easy, and I felt rather frustrated along the way, but we got there! After lunch, I led a codealong where we built our FastAPI routers, db, sql and main.py files from scratch and tested our endpoints. Of course we ran into bugs along the way, but with each other's help, and some much appreciated instructor guidance, we got our CRUD (mostly) functioning for the users and games apis.
Next up on our list for the week is authorization and authentication. Eugene and Ovidiu will be leading a code along to implement auth into our backend on Friday.

Yesterday and today we went through the JWTDown auth tutorial for Galvanize's auth dependency. Though there were several differing examples of implementation, we managed to get a working User authentication/authorization functionality, including login, logout and signup endpoints. As a team, we talked about where our individual levels of understanding are, and how to best move forward so that everyone can uniquely contribute to the project development.

Over the weekend, I began exploring Redux through several YouTube tutorial videos. Today, the team planned out our week based on learning Redux, finishing up auth on the backend, and implementing a basic React frontend representation of user data. I am feeling motivated to get as much of our mvps done before next week as possible, so we can work on stretch goals and ultimately deployment.
