Yesterday and today marked the first steps in my journey of creating a full scale, deployable web app with a team of three other Hack Reactor cohort mates. Jonathan C., Ovidiu Buta, and Eugene Hong I are designing and building a trivia based single player game using ReactJS, FastAPI, MongoDB and Redux, which will track user game stats, incorporate a simple social networking feature, and *as stretch goals* integrate game music + a modern GUI.

I'll be chronicling our progress here, as we weave together user authentication, gameplay, and myriad APIs. I know it won't be easy, but I'm excited to take the next step towards becoming a full stack web developer!

Today we finished our api endpoint markdown and began planning our project implementation. I set up API Endpoint and React/Redux frontend boards on Trello and led the standup. In tandem with our design overview, we worked individually on working through the FastAPI tutorial videos to familiarize ourselves with the new framework.
