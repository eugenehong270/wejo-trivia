Yesterday and today marked the first steps in my journey of creating a full scale, deployable web app with a team of three other Hack Reactor cohort mates. Jonathan C., Ovidiu Buta, and Eugene Hong I are designing and building a trivia based single player game using ReactJS, FastAPI, MongoDB and Redux, which will track user game stats, incorporate a simple social networking feature, and *as stretch goals* integrate game music + a modern GUI.

I'll be chronicling our progress here, as we weave together user authentication, gameplay, and myriad APIs. I know it won't be easy, but I'm excited to take the next step towards becoming a full stack web developer!

Today we finished our api endpoint markdown and began planning our project implementation. I set up API Endpoint, React/Redux frontend, and Documentation boards on Trello and led the standup/standown. In tandem with our design overview, we worked individually through the FastAPI tutorial videos to familiarize ourselves with the new framework.
I find FastAPI / PostgreSQL to be quite dense so far, and am looking forward to completing more tutorials and getting a few of our endpoints up and running by the end of the week. Excited to learn about authorization bearer tokens, and will try to get a basic version of the game working in React by next week.
