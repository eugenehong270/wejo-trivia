On November 9, 2022, my team and I embarked on a journey to create a web app using ReactJS, FastAPI, MongoDB, and Redux. We were four Hack Reactor cohort mates - Waylen Roch√©(to sound fancy), Jonathan Conner and Eugene Hong - and we set out to design and build a trivia-based single player game that would track user game stats and incorporate a simple social networking feature. Our stretch goals included integrating game music and a modern GUI.

Over the next few weeks, we worked on setting up our API endpoints, planning our project implementation, and familiarizing ourselves with FastAPI. It was not easy, but we persevered and managed to get our CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality working for the users and games APIs.

Next up on our list was authentication, and Eugene and I led a code along to implement it into our backend. It was a steep learning curve, but we eventually got our user authentication and authorization working, with login, logout, and signup endpoints.

I took the opportunity to explore Redux/React through YouTube videos and built the logic for our Trivia game, I initially used "let" and later on we changed them to "const", but the game was working fine with "let".

Over the next few days, we continued to work on implementing Redux Toolkit and getting authentication working on the game play and user profile endpoints. It was a challenging process, but with determination and some help from our instructors, we succeeded.

By November 28, we had successfully implemented authentication on the game play and user profile endpoints, and we were able to store and retrieve user game history data. It was a major accomplishment, but we knew we still had a long way to go. We continued to work hard, and by November 30, we had completed the basic functionality of our web app.

It was a challenging and rewarding journey, but I am proud of what we accomplished. I learned a lot, and I am excited to continue developing my skills as a full stack web developer.
